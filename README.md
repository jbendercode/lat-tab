#### History

- Version 1.0 was created by [jbendercode](https://github.com/jbendercode) in this [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lattab-learn-latin-prover/eiocjaocpmackhbaffoejkcmnfbdpgpj). Which is now deprecated.
- Josh graciously said I could take it over and release a version 2.0 of the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lattab-20-latin-proverbs/lnbjfdfjlppgedgfbplminickpldmcin) which is where you are now.
